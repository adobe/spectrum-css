    box-shadow offset/blur is hardcoded here as it cannot be adjusted when scale changes,

    we can't use box-shadow anymore because it renders along the rectangle that encloses the triangle instead
    of along the triangle's diagonal borders.
    we may be able to use box-shadow for the popover + drop-shadow just for the tip, each direction would need it's own
    and it may still have the problem where the tip's shadow would cover the popover border just a little and make it look sloppy again
