## Confirmation
This is the default variant for alert dialogs. Use a confirmation variant for asking a user to confirm a choice.

## Information
Information alert dialogs communicate important information that a user needs to acknowledge. Before using this kind of alert dialog, make sure it’s the appropriate communication channel for the message instead of a toast or a more lightweight messaging option.

Note that an alert dialog can have a total of 3 buttons if the secondary outline button label is defined.
