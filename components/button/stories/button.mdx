# Button

## Variants

There are four available variants that are used for different levels of emphasis and different
types of actions. By default, a button uses the fill style with a solid background. The primary
and secondary variants also have an outline option.

### Accent

The call to action button communicates strong emphasis and is reserved for encouraging critical
actions. In general, only use the emphasized option for the most important action on the page.

### Primary

The primary button is for medium emphasis. Use it in place of a call to action button when the
action requires less prominence, or if there are multiple primary actions of the same importance
in the same view. Both the fill (default) and outline styles are demonstrated below:

### Secondary

The secondary button is for low emphasis. It’s paired with other button types to surface less
prominent actions, and should never be the only button in a group. Both the fill (default) and
outline styles are demonstrated below:

### Negative

The negative button is for emphasizing actions that can be destructive or have negative
consequences if taken. Use it sparingly.

## Static color

When a button needs to be placed on top of a color background or a visual, use the static color
option. Static color buttons do not change shades or values depending upon the color theme.

## Sizing

Buttons come in four different sizes: small, medium, large, and extra large. The medium size is
the default and most frequently used option. Use the other sizes sparingly; they should be used
to create a hierarchy of importance within the page.

## Pending state

The pending button is for indicating that a quick progress action is taking place. In this case, the
label and optional icon disappear and a progress circle appears. The progress circle always shows an
indeterminate progress. We recommend the use of the `.is-pending` class on the component’s parent
container, but there is also an option to use an attribute of `pending` instead. Buttons should have
the disabled attribute when the pending state is applied.

## Disabled state

A button in a disabled state shows that an action exists, but is not available in that circumstance. 
This state can be used to maintain layout continuity and to communicate that an action may become
available later.

## Text overflow behavior

When the button text is too long for the horizontal space available, it wraps to form another line. 
When there is no icon present, the text is aligned center. When there is an icon present, the text is
aligned `start` (left with a writing direction of left-to-right) and the icon remains vertically aligned
at the top.
