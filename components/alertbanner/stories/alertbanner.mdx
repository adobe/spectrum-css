It will occupy all the available horizontal space until it reaches its maximum allowed width.

## Semantic Variants

An alert banner always has a semantic meaning and uses semantic colors. The available options are neutral, informative, and negative.

### Neutral

<Canvas of={AlertBannerStories.Neutral} />

### Informative

<Canvas of={AlertBannerStories.Informative} />

### Negative

<Canvas of={AlertBannerStories.Negative} />

## Actionable and dismissable

An alert banner ideally provides a way for a user to address an issue in-line with an action. It can have both an icon-only close button and a button with a contextual action to take. There should never be more than one button with a contextual action in an alert banner.

## Text overflow behavior

When the text is too long for the available horizontal space, it wraps to form another line. In actionable alert banners, the button moves below the text.
