### Major Changes

- [#2786](https://github.com/adobe/spectrum-css/pull/2786) [`6c19fcf`](https://github.com/adobe/spectrum-css/commit/6c19fcf3f0eda76987f338981ae20f9999febce6) Thanks [@pfulton](https://github.com/pfulton)! - ## Breaking change

  This major update creates a bridge between the Spectrum 1 (S1) and Spectrum 2 (S2) designs, dubbed "Spectrum 2 Foundations". These do _NOT_ reflect a fully migrated S2 component. This approach allows consumers to swap the appearance of their components between S1, Express, and S2 by leveraging a "system" layer that remaps the necessary component-level tokens to the appropriate token dataset.

  For these components to appear S2, you must load the assets with the `@spectrum-css/tokens` at `v16` or higher.

  For S1 or Express, load assets with the `@spectrum-css/tokens` at `v14.x` or `v15.x`.

  If you are looking to implement a fully S2 design, please explore the `next` tag releases instead of using this foundations release. **This release is used in Spectrum Web Components 1.x**.

  ### Deprecations

  The `metadata` folder containing the `mods.md` and `metadata.json` assets has been removed from source. To find information about the components including what selectors, modifiers, and passthroughs are used, please see the `dist/metadata.json` asset shipped with every component containing CSS.

  The `index-vars.css` asset has been removed in this release as it was previously deprecated and is no longer maintained. Please use the `index.css` or `index-base.css`

  ### File usage

  If you are rendering components and need **only** the S2 Foundations styles, you can make use of the `index.css` asset which contains all the base styles plus the system mappings for S2 Foundations.

  If you are using this version to publish **only** an S1 or Express component, you can use the `index-base.css` plus the desired `themes/(spectrum|express).css` file.

  To render a component that can be easily swapped between the S2 Foundations, S1, or Express contexts, load `index-base.css` with the `index-theme.css` file and leverage the appropriate context classes (`.spectrum--legacy` for S1 and `.spectrum--express` for Express).
