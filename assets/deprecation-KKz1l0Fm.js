This component has been removed from the Spectrum CSS monorepo and will no longer receive new features. Bug fixes will be patched on a as-needed basis. If you find a critical bug, please open a bug report.

Bug fixes will not longer be supported after the project migrates fully to Spectrum 2 (date TBD).
