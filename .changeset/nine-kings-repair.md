#### S2 Button migration

Button now uses Spectrum 2 tokens and specifications, which includes many color changes to all variants. A few other notable changes:

- Outline buttons are no longer available in accent and negative options - use the filled variant instead.
- Medium size is now the default. The class `.spectrum-Button--sizeM` is now unnecessary for this size, and has been removed.
- The `.spectrum-Button--fill` class is no longer needed and has been removed.
