## Feature [@spectrum-css/icon]

Update source files to load the mappings from component-level to global tokens for size and transform values. This will allow for more consistent and predictable behavior when using the `size` and `transform` props on icons when switching between contexts for S1, S2, and Express.

## Patch [@spectrum-css/typography]

Remove the sourcemap footer from compiled assets.
