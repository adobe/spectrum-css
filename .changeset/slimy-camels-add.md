### Including the touch action rule for draggable content

The slider, color slider, color area, color wheel, color handle all deserve to have their touch-action property manages so that trying to set the value of those interfaces doesn't cause page scrolling in touch context.

Adding `touch-action: none` to a slider or any draggable component is necessary to prevent the browser's default touch behaviors—such as scrolling, pinch-zooming, or double-tap zooming—from interfering with the component's intended interaction.
