S2 Foundations fixes

- Adjusts corner rounding for S2 foundations to follow S2 action button corner rounding, particularly to help give additional space to the help/corner triangle icon:
  - corner-radius-medium-size-extra-small
  - corner-radius-medium-size-small
  - corner-radius-medium-size-medium
  - corner-radius-medium-size-large
  - corner-radius-medium-size-extra-large
- Corrects the `disabled-background-color` and `disabled-static-*-background-color` tokens for the disabled and selected+disabled states
