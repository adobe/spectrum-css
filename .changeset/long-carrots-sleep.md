## S2 Collapsed search field

The search component allows for a minimized state where the search field is collapsed to a button.

### Anatomy

The collapsed state consists of a single action button that has a hover, keyboard focused, and disabled state. This state is triggered by the `is-collapsed` class on the search component. When the search field is in this state, the textfield is hidden and the search button is displayed. The button can be hovered and focused, and will expand the search field when clicked.

### Usage

The collapsed state is used to reduce the amount of space taken up by the search field. It is most commonly used next a filter button to allow users to quickly search and filter content.
