Removes some legacy vendor prefixes that are no longer necessary, including some that were for older browsers that are no longer in browser support list for Spectrum CSS. Such as Microsoft Edge before version 79. Includes some cleanup around some of the related normalization styles in the Text field component and the Commons `%spectrum-BaseButton` (used for multiple button components).
