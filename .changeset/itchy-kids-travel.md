#### Spectrum 2 migration

This is the Spectrum 2 styles migration of the progress circle. The original markup has changed to an svg and circle element to allow CSS styles such as `stroke-linecap`. This was necessary to match the design. The `--small/--medium/--large` sizing classes have been deprecated in favor of t-shirt classes `--sizeS/--sizeM/--sizeL`

##### Animation

`@keyframes spectrum-dashoffset-animation`:
This animation was created by React Spectrum and used to keep the same speed and bezier curve.
