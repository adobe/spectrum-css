### In-field button S2 Migration

In-field buttons are used to represent actions within input fields. They’re currently used inside the combo box, number field, and search field. This component has updated colors, corner radius, and icons compared to the Spectrum 1 version. The “Error” and “Key-focus” variants have been removed, since this now utilizes those states from the parent component.

The position styles and controls have also been removed now that there's a consistent corner radius.
