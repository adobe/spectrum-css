#### Spectrum 2 migration

This migration includes updated colors, rounding, a bigger tip, and the removal of variants (only neutral is available in Spectrum 2). As a result of the deprecation of variants, icons have also been removed.

The redesign of the tip, specifically the rounding, required a reworking of how we use clip-path and transform.
