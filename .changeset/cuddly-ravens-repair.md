"@spectrum-tools/postcss-add-theming-layer": major
---

The PostCSS plugin previously published as `postcss-splitinator`. This new package creates a polyfill for style queries by creating a layer of `--system` prefixed custom properties to be loaded by attaching a unique selector. This allows the toggling of component-level property definitions by theme or context. There are many options available to customize the output that are documented in the package [README](plugins/postcss-add-theming-layer/README.md).
