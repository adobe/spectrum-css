Minor storybook updates and fixes including some whitespace changes.

A bug was fixed with the HTML code preview that was displaying duplicate line numbers.

Some key metadata was incorporated into the preview head file for better contextual information when published.

The remark-gfm dependency was added to support tables in the \*.mdx files for Storybook.
