## Infield Progresscircle S2 Migration

In-field progress circle is a new component created to replace progress circle (size S) in t-shirt size components. The button, textfield, combo box, and picker `template.js` files have all been updated to call for infield progress circles. This component comes in four sizes: (S, M, L, XL), has updated color variants (default, white, black), and has a unified track thickness.
