CSS references to popover custom properties/tokens were updated to reflect changes in the popover ([#3365](https://github.com/adobe/spectrum-css/pull/3365)). The corner radius token was updated to correspond to the new S2 popover corner radius.

- `--spectrum-border-width-100` was updated to `--spectrum-corner-radius-large-default`
