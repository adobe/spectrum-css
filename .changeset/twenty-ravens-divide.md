CSS references to popover custom properties/tokens were updated to reflect some mod name changes in the S2 popover (#3365). The corner radius token was updated to correspond to the new S2 popover corner radius, as well as some updated popover mod names:

- `--mod-popover-content-area-spacing-vertical` was updated to `--mod-popover-content-area-spacing`.
- `--spectrum-border-width-100` was updated to `--spectrum-corner-radius-large-default`
