Restores drop shadow for nested popovers. This is done by moving the default popover to `box-shadow` and using `filter` for popovers with tip. This allows for visual consistency across all popovers.

#### New mods

`--mod-popover-box-shadow`

#### New custom properties

`--spectrum-popover-box-shadow`
