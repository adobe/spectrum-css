"@spectrum-css/alertbanner": minor
---

The alert banner component now occupies all available space until it reaches the maximum allowed width.
The token previously used for the fixed width, `--spectrum-alert-banner-width`, is now used for the maximum width.
This includes the additional of a new mod custom property: `--mod-alert-banner-max-inline-size`
