"@spectrum-css/contextualhelp": patch
---

Added `--mod-spectrum-contextual-help-popover-maximum-width` to customize popover max-width via `max-inline-size`. SWC had a feature request from the express team to support long text in the contextual-help popover. Jira ticket: [SWC-509](https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/SWC-509)
