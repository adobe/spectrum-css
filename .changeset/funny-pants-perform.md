"@spectrum-css/menu": patch
---

By adding additional system mappings for the menu item, we are able to support box-shadow styling for Spectrum 1 and Express, while updating to outline styles for Spectrum 2 (S2) foundations.

For S2 foundations, a margin is leveraged on the Menu item to leave space for the outline width and outline offset. This is reflected in the padding present for the menu items in the design specifications for S2.
