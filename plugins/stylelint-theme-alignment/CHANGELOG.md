### Major Changes

- [#3026](https://github.com/adobe/spectrum-css/pull/3026) [`544a803`](https://github.com/adobe/spectrum-css/commit/544a8039e84423a4db3137a0688f27b7812e291f) Thanks [@castastrophe](https://github.com/castastrophe)! - Initial release of the stylelint theme alignment tool. This package uses the base file (themes/spectrum.css) for a Spectrum CSS component as a "source of truth" and validates the sub-themes (i.e., themes/express.css) use only selectors and custom properties defined in the base file.
