1. Auto-fix results based on settings defined by the `stylelint.config.js` unless it requires rewriting more than 30% of the line. Changes that impact more than 30% of the original content should prompt for update.
2. Copyrights should reflect the current year.
3. Comments added should always use sentence, never title case.
4. Any files removed should also be removed from the exports of the component's package.json.
5. Never rename a custom property without prompting for approval first or being expressly asked to update the custom property name.
6. Sort high-contrast and other media queries to the bottom of the CSS file.
7. Warn about or suggest fixes for duplicate properties; always opt to keep the definition that honors the CSS cascade.
