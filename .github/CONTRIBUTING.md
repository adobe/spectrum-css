[Grp-opensourceoffice@adobe.com](mailto:Grp-opensourceoffice@adobe.com).

## Submitting a contribution

All submissions should come in the form of pull requests and need to be reviewed
by project committers.

Start by [forking](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the repo, then [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) your fork:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:yourusername/spectrum-css.git
```

Set up a branch for your feature or bug fix, push it to your fork, and set up a remote for the upstream repo:

```shell
git checkout -b feat-my-awesome-new-feature
git push -u origin feat-my-awesome-new-feature
git remote add upstream git@github.com:adobe/spectrum-css.git
```

Install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install):

```shell
brew install yarn || curl -o- -L https://yarnpkg.com/install.sh | bash
```

Install dependencies:

```shell
yarn install
```

To generate a new component, run the generator:

```shell
yarn new component
```

To kick-off the project's storybook locally, run:

```shell
yarn start
```

This is our development environment, where you can see all the components in action, and develop new components. All components must have a storybook entry.

Working on the documentation site? Run:

```shell
yarn dev
```

Commit all changes with a [conventional commit message](https://www.conventionalcommits.org), making sure to correctly use `feat:`, `fix:`, and `BREAKING CHANGE` accordingly, and referencing the relevant issue number (if any):

```shell
git commit -m "fix(calendar): rendering issue in Safari, fixes #252"
```

Make sure your branch is up to date with the original repo:

```shell
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
```

Run your updates through the formatter which will automatically fix any linting issues. Note that this is also handled on commit via lint-staged so running this manually is only necessary if you used a `--no-verify` flag on any of your commits.

```shell
nx affected --target format
```

Review your changes and any possible conflicts and push to your fork:

```shell
git push origin
```
