## Submitting a contribution

All submissions should come in the form of pull requests and need to be reviewed
by project committers.

Start by [forking](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the repo, then [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) your fork:

```
git clone git@github.com:yourusername/spectrum-css.git
```

Set up a branch for your feature or bug fix, push it to your fork, and set up a remote for the upstream repo:

```
git checkout -b my-awesome-new-feature
git push -u origin my-awesome-new-feature
git remote add upstream git@github.com:adobe/spectrum-css.git
```

Install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install):

```
brew install yarn || curl -o- -L https://yarnpkg.com/install.sh | bash
```

Make sure the [gulp-cli](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp-cli) is installed globally:

```
yarn global add gulp-cli
```

Install dependencies:

```
yarn install
```

Build the project, open a livereloading browser window, and watch for changes:

```
gulp dev
```

Commit changes with a [conventional commit message](https://www.conventionalcommits.org), making sure to correctly use `feat:`, `fix:`, and `BREAKING CHANGE` accordingly, and referencing the relevant issue number (if any):

```
git commit -m "fix: calendar rendering issue in Safari, fixes #252"
```

Make sure your branch is up to date with the original repo:

```
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
```

Review your changes and any possible conflicts and push to your fork:

```
git push origin
```

[Submit a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).

At this point you're waiting on us. We do our best to keep on top of all the pull requests. We may suggest some changes, improvements or alternatives.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

- Write a good pull request description, include screenshots, and test your changes across all evergreen browsers (and IE 11, sadly)
- Make sure the PR merges cleanly with the latest main.
- Describe your feature/bugfix and why it's needed/important in the pull request description.
