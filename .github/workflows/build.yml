name: Validate successful build
#
# This workflow validates that the commit in question can be built successfully
# in several environments:
#
#   Systems:    Ubuntu, MacOS, // Windows
#   Node:       18
#
# After the build is successful, the compiled assets are uploaded as an artifact
# to the workflow run. This allows us to download the compiled assets and use
# them in other workflows.
#
# Note: we need to skip the nx cache b/c it does not contain the compiled assets
