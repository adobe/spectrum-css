## Show me a demo

Check out [the documentation site](http://opensource.adobe.com/spectrum-css/) for a demo of every component included in Spectrum CSS.

## Where is the JavaScript?

Spectrum CSS is CSS-only, implementing only the interactivity that can be done with pure CSS. Thus, Spectrum CSS should only be used by implementations of Spectrum, or very simple applications that only need things like typography, checkboxes, textfields, etc.

Adobe maintains separate JavaScript libraries written with React, Angular, and web components that use Spectrum CSS to create fully interactive Spectrum components. These libraries will be open sourced soon.

## Using Spectrum CSS

The preferred method of using Spectrum CSS relies on custom properties to swap out variables for different themes and colorstops. This has the lowest bundle size and the simplest usage, but is incompatible with < IE 11

To use Spectrum CSS with IE 11 or without, see the [legacy usage documentation](README-legacy.md).

### Installing components

Each component is released on npm as a separate, individually versioned package inside of the [`@spectrum-css` org](https://www.npmjs.com/org/spectrum-css).

To get started, install the following components:

```
npm install @spectrum-css/vars @spectrum-css/typography @spectrum-css/page @spectrum-css/icon @spectrum-css/button
```

Installed components will be available in the `node_modules/@spectrum-css/` folder.

If you are an existing user of Spectrum CSS and rely on the previous bundle package format, see the [legacy usage documentation](README-legacy.md) for details.

### Using components

Spectrum CSS components have build output that uses CSS custom properties to change themes and scales. This has the lowest bundle size and the simplest usage, but is incompatible with IE 11.

To use Spectrum CSS with IE 11, see the [legacy usage documentation](README-legacy.md).

If you're targeting modern browsers, start by including the base set of variables:

```html
<!-- Include global variables first -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/@spectrum-css/vars@^2.0.0-alpha/dist/spectrum-global.css">

<!-- Include only the scales your application needs -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/@spectrum-css/vars@^2.0.0-alpha/dist/spectrum-medium-unique.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/@spectrum-css/vars@^2.0.0-alpha/dist/spectrum-large-unique.css">

<!-- Include only the colorstops your application needs -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/@spectrum-css/vars@^2.0.0-alpha/dist/spectrum-lightest.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/@spectrum-css/vars@^2.0.0-alpha/dist/spectrum-light.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/@spectrum-css/vars@^2.0.0-alpha/dist/spectrum-dark.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/@spectrum-css/vars@^2.0.0-alpha/dist/spectrum-darkest.css">

<!-- Include index-vars.css for all components you need -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/@spectrum-css/page@^2.0.0-alpha/dist/index-vars.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/@spectrum-css/typography@^2.0.0-alpha/dist/index-vars.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/@spectrum-css/icon@^2.0.0-alpha/dist/index-vars.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/@spectrum-css/button@^2.0.0-alpha/dist/index-vars.css">
```

Then, make sure you've included the relevant classes to choose which scale and colorstop you want:

```html
<body class="spectrum spectrum--medium spectrum--light">
```

Then you can use components by copy/pasting their code from [the documentation](http://opensource.adobe.com/spectrum-css/).

With the magic of CSS custom properties, you can infinitely nest different color stops and themes, [as illustrated here](https://codepen.io/lazd/pen/axXMRL).

Additionally, you can override variables and customize Spectrum CSS' look and feel by re-defining the custom properties in context, [like so](https://codepen.io/lazd/pen/ROvOPO). See the source in `components/*/index-vars.css` to determine which custom properties you can override.

### Importing UI icons

Some components require certain "UI icons" to render. To get these icons, you'll need to use [`loadicons`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/loadicons).

For most use cases, you'll want to use `spectrum-css-icons.svg` so you have support for both scales:

```js
<script src="https://unpkg.com/loadicons@1.0.0/index.js"></script>
<script>
  loadIcons('https://unpkg.com/@spectrum-css/icon@^2.0.0-alpha/dist/spectrum-css-icons.svg');
</script>
```

Based on which scales you'll be using, you can choose to load different files:

* `@spectrum-css/icon/dist/spectrum-css-icons.svg` - Both medium and large icons for responsive UIs that support both `.spectrum--medium` and `.spectrum--large`
* `@spectrum-css/icon/dist/spectrum-css-icons-medium.svg` - Medium icons only, supports `.spectrum--medium` only
* `@spectrum-css/icon/dist/spectrum-css-icons-large.svg` - Large icons only, supports `.spectrum--large` only


**Note:** If you're using `spectrum-css-icons.svg`, be sure to add `.spectrum--medium` or `.spectrum--large` to the `<html>` element, or you'll see both medium and large icons at once.

### Importing workflow icons

If your app has any level of complexity, you'll need "workflow" icons to indicate actions. These icons are not required to render the base components, and instead are used within buttons or menu items for actions like share, play, justify, save, etc.

These icons are released within in the bundle package as `@spectrum-css/spectrum-css/dist/icons/spectrum-icons.svg`. You can import the entire set of icons in all sizes as follows:

```js
loadIcons('https://unpkg.com/@adobe/spectrum-css-workflow-icons@1.0.0-beta.6/dist/spectrum-icons.svg');
```

You can then use the icons in your app. Visit the [Spectrum CSS workflow icon list](http://opensource.adobe.com/spectrum-css/icons/) and click on any icon to get the markup.

### Language support

To take advantage of locale specific changes such as placeholders not italicizing Japanese, your application should specify a [`Content-Language` response header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Language) or set the [`lang` attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/lang).

```html
<html lang="ja">
```

## Contributing

Check out the [contributing guidelines](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) for quick start information, and head over to the [component documentation](components/README.md) and [bundle documentation](bundles/README.md) for more information.

### Building

Run the following commands:

```
npm install -g gulp-cli
npm install
gulp dev
```

Your `dist/` folder should now have a local copy of the Spectrum CSS docs and minimal CSS files, and your browser should be open with the project documentation. Editing any of the `.css` or `.yml` files in `components/*` will update the project documentation and live reload in your browser.

**Important:** Ensure you have Node.js > 10.10 installed or the build system will not run. Node.js > 12.x is preferred.

### Documentation site

Building the project will build and launch the project documentation site in your browser automatically.

See [site generation](site/README.md) and [documentation generation](tools/bundle-builder/docs/README.md) for more information.

### CLI

The following tasks are available:

- `gulp build` - Performs a build of all components and the top level package
- `gulp buildComponents` - Performs a build of all components
- `gulp dev` - Performs a lite build (custom properties only), opens your browser with the documentation site, then starts watching components and website files
- `gulp clean` - Cleans all output files for the project and all components
- `gulp watch` - Assuming a build has already been performed, immediately opens your browser with the documentation site, then starts watching components and website files
- `gulp buildCombined` - Builds the combined output files (`dist/spectrum-*.css`)
- `gulp buildStandalone` - Builds the standalone output files (`dist/standalone/spectrum-*.css`)
- `gulp release` - Performs a release of the top-level package

## Testing

To perform manual testing of the latest version of each component:

```
gulp dev
```

To perform manual testing of the backwards-compatible bundle package:

```
cd bundles/spectrum-css-compat
gulp dev
```

## Releasing

Releasing is handled by Lerna. When any component or its dependencies change, Lerna will queue that component (and all of its dependents) up for a release. Additionally, if any component included by a bundle changes, the bundle will be queued up for a release.

To release everything that has changed, simply run:

```
npm run release
```

After you enter version numbers for all changed components and bundles, Lerna and npm scripts will handle the rest, including deployed documentation sites.
